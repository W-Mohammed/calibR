  # Calibration Specifications

  ## Model:
  The model (Nicolas _et al.,_, 2017) is adapted from approaches for modelling HIV in high-burden settings. The population is divided into five health states including non-susceptible (N), susceptible (S), early disease (E), late disease (L), and treatment (T). The number of individuals by state and year (t) is given by $N_t$, $S_t$, $E_t$, $L_t$, and $T_t$ respectively. Individuals enter the model distributed across the $N$ and $S$ states, and transition between states to allow for infection ($S$ to $E$), disease progression ($E$ to $L$), treatment initiation ($E$ and $L$ to $T$), and death ($N$, $S$, $E$, $L$ and $T$ to $D$) via background and disease-specific mortality.

The diagram below represents the model.

## Inputs to be calibrated:
- `mu_e` Cause-specific mortality rate with early-stage disease
- `mu_l` Cause-specific mortality rate with late-stage disease
- `mu_t` Cause-specific mortality rate on treatment
- `p` Transition rate from early to late-stage disease
- `r_l` Rate of uptake onto treatment (r_l = late-stage disease)
- `rho` Effective contact rate
- `b` Fraction of population in at-risk group

## Targets:
- `Surv` HIV survival (in years) without treatment
- `Prev` Prevalence at 10, 20, 30 years
- `Trt_vol` Treatment volume (in $000) at 30 years

# Search method:
Random search using:
  - Full factorial grid
- Random grid
- Latin-Hypercube Sampling

# Goodness-of-fit measure:
- Sum of log-likelihoods
- Sum of squared errors

# Visualise target data:

```{r Visualise the target}
# Plotting target data - survival ("Surv"):
targets_pt = ggplot(data = HID_data$l_targets$Surv,
                    aes(x = time,
                        y = value)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lb, ymax = ub)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = 'black')
  ) +
  labs(title = "Calibration target",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Proportion survived")

targets_pt2 = ggplot(data = lst_targets$Surv,
                     aes(x = time,
